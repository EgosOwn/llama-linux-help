# LLaMA Linux Helper üêßü§ùü¶ô

This simple Python script wraps [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) to generate and (optionally) execute Linux shell commands from natural language. (NO GPU REQUIRED)

By default, it will use ~/llama.cpp/models/7B/ggml-model-f16-ggjt.bin but you can change this with the environment variables LLAMA_DIR and LINUX_HELP_LLAMA_MODEL respectively. The latter is a model file relative to the LLAMA_DIR/models/ directory.

I tested it with both LLaMA 7B and LLaMA 30B* (*actually Alpaca 30B but I don't think it matters since I don't use the instruct prompt)

There is a speed trade off, the larger models produce better results but take longer to run. On my i5-8400 32GB RAM system (with model on NVME SSD) I find 7B faster than searching the web or deciphering man pages, but not so for 30B.

# Installation and Usage

You need python and [llama-cpp-python](https://pypi.org/project/llama-cpp-python/) installed. From there you can drop the script, make it executable, and run it like so:

```./linux-help.py "Create zip file containing data.txt"```

Example result:

```zip -r data.zip data.txt```

It will ask if you want to run the resulting command, enter "y" if so, otherwise the command will not run.



# Why use it over ChatGPT, Copilot, or other 'models as a service'?

Self hosted models allow for privacy and less opportunity for censorship/bias. You never have to worry about the server going down and you can use it offline (which is great for places with no or poor internet connections, like at remote locations or on flights).

# TODO (help welcome)

* Allow controling llama.cpp parameters from arguments
* Add option to include command explanation
* Auto choose model if none is specified via argument or environment variable
* Add option to dump to a .sh file when LLaMA produces results starting with a shebang.
* Bash/zsh auto completion
* Do an Alpaca-type fine tuning (Will never distribute resulting model)

Maybe:

* Multiple prompt options
* Auto or manually specify distro or shell in the prompt
* Allow executing on remote SSH server (but copy back the results to run them)
* YOLO mode - Flag to auto exec resulting command (WCGW)
* Daemon mode to contextually suggest commands based on current session (Copilot will do this so likely will never implement)
* OpenAI API integration for faster results (won't be default and will require API key). Would fall back to llama.cpp if API is unreachable.
